# Recovery and continuation — 16 September 2026

The user requested completion of all remaining active reviews after a computer
crash. The starting queue contained 644 completed reviews, 270 pending reviews
and one record outside the active scope.

The last completion, TCS-6659, survived in its canonical card and queue entry
with a matching SHA-256 hash. Its ledger entry was lost: the suffix of
reviews.jsonl consisted of 4,005 null bytes. The entry was reconstructed from
the card's saved quality review, status note and queue input hash. The original
ledger and reservations were copied to the ignored local recovery cache before
any change. An explicit recovery record was appended.

All 18 reservations from the stopped sessions were released after checking
their canonical input hashes and the surviving process/session evidence.
The detailed record is in [recovery.json](recovery.json). Relevant earlier user
scope choices were recovered into
[prior-user-decisions.json](prior-user-decisions.json). Their Czech wording is
preserved as quoted user input, not new project prose.

The individual authoring scripts in this directory retain the reviewed
statements, definitions, source scopes and completion notes. They use the shared
claim/hash/lock mechanism and are intended to run once per still-pending card.
Completed cards remain canonical in data/cards/; a newly resolved card is
moved intact through the normal archive workflow.

Completed in this continuation:

- TCS-6770: the approved uniform polynomial coefficient/length simulation
  question, with unrestricted memory.
- TCS-0805: the original sub-base-two exact counting question, completed and
  archived after reviewing Oka's August 2026 preprint.
- TCS-3075: the approved planar perfect matching sampling specialization,
  including the error and parallel computation model.
- TCS-4193: the approved randomized general-graph LOCAL lower-bound target.
- TCS-3381: the approved leaderless population protocol question, measured in
  the original quantified Presburger formula.

For TCS-0805, the review covered the complete new proof: the chain-partition
bound, forced profile decoding, aggregation by released count and deadline,
state enumeration, and polynomial bit lengths. Both exponential-base
inequalities were checked with exact integer/rational powers. The author
verifier passed for all 5,231 naturally labeled posets of orders one through
six, 100 random instances, and 120 targeted instances. These finite tests are
supporting evidence, not a substitute for the proof or a Lean formalization.
The source remains explicitly identified as a preprint.

The initial recovery checkpoint passed make check, the bundled KaTeX checks
on all active cards, and the desktop/mobile reader checks in tests/pages.cjs.
Each completion is validated and locally published. The live queue and
unfinished inventory remain authoritative; this checkpoint does not mark the
entire task complete.
